Flat HTML site
---
Uses Assemble and Handlebars to create a basic flat HTML website.
 
**requires node (npm) and grunt**

### To run
**Install npm packages** - only really need to run this the first time.

```npm install```

**Compile the HTML files**

``` grunt build ``` 
* Runs Assemble to build the flat HTML files
* Puts the compiled HTML files into the "build" folder.

I suggest running [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) out of your build folder while running the ```grunt watch``` task for the best development experience.
